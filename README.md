In brief, it is a vertical board with 42 windows in 6 rows and 7 columns.
Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins), each of which uses a different color. The board is empty at the beginning of the game.
The goal of the two players is to make a straight line of four pieces of their own; the line may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
